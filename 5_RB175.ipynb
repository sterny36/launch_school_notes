    "### Summary\n",
    "- Sinatra is a small web framework.\n",
    "- HTTP requests are handled in Sinatra by creating routes for a path or set of paths.\n",
    "- Routes are created using methods named after the HTTP method to be handled. So, a GET request is handled by a route defined using the get Sinatra method.\n",
    "- View templates can be written in many templating languages, such as ERB. They provide a place to define the HTML display of a response outside of the route handling it. Templating languages are usually better suited to describing HTML than plain Ruby.\n",
    "- A layout is a view template that surrounds a specific response's template. They are used to provide shared HTML that is used by all views, and often include links to stylesheets and JavaScript files.\n",
    "- Routes can specify parameters by using colon followed by the parameter name: /chapters/:number. In this case, the value would be accessible within the route using params[:number].\n",
    "- Code placed in a before block is executed before the matching route for every request.\n",
    "- View helpers are Ruby methods that are used to minimize the amount of Ruby code included in a view template. These methods are defined within a helpers block in Sinatra.\n",
    "- A user can be sent to a new location in response to a request with redirection. This is done in Sinatra using the redirect method.\n",
    "- The redirection is accomplished by setting the Location header in the response. The client looks at the URL in the location header and sends out a new HTTP GET request for the associated resource, which in turn navigates the client to that new location.\n",
    "- The files in a project can be identified as either server-side or client-side code based on where they will be evaluated.- "

    "- State is data that persists over time.\n",
    "- The session provides a way to store data that will persist between subsequent HTTP requests. This data is associated with a specific user by storing a cookie in their browser. In Sinatra, the session data itself is also stored in this cookie, but this is configurable and not always the case with other web frameworks.\n",
    "- Data that is submitted to the server often needs to be validated to ensure it meets the requirements of the application. In this lesson we built server-side validation as we performed the validation logic on the server.\n",
    "- Messages that need to be displayed to the user on their next request and then deleted can be stored in the session. This kind of message is often referred to as a flash message.\n",
    "- Content from within a view template can be stored under a name and retrieved later using content_for and yield_content.\n",
    "- GET requests should only request data. Any request that modifies data should be over POST or another non-GET method.\n",
