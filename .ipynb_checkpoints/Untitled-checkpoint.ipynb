It includes CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, ADD COLUMN, and several other statements for creating or modifying the structure of or rules that govern the data that is held within a database.\n",
    "    - DML (Data manipulation langugae): This part of the SQL language is what allows a user to retrieve or modify the data stored within a database. Some databases consider the retrieval and manipulation as two separate languages themselves, but PostgreSQL's documentation combines them and accordingly, we will as well.

    "- varchar(N): This data type specifies that information stored in a column can contain strings of up to N characters in length. If a string less than length N is stored, then the remaining string length isn't used.\n",
    "- boolean: This is a data type that can only contain two values \"true\" or \"false\". In PostgreSQL, boolean values are often displayed in a shorthand format, t or f\n",
    "- integer or INT: An integer is simply a \"whole number.\" An example might be 1 or 50, -50, or 792197 depending on what storage type is used.\n",
    "- decimal(precision, scale): The decimal type takes two arguments, one being the total number of digits in the entire number on both sides of the decimal point (the precision), the second is the number of the digits in the fractional part of the number to the right of the decimal point (the scale).\n",
    "- timestamp: The timestamp type contains both a simple date and time in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.\n",

    "- UNIQUE: column can't contain duplicate values.\n",

    "  - Natural keys\n",
    "    - A natural key is an existing value in a dataset that can be used to uniquely identify each row of data in that dataset.\n",
    "  - Surrogate key\n",
    "    - A surrogate key is a value that is created solely for the purpose of identifying a row of data in a database table. Because it is created specifically for that purpose, it can avoid many of the problems associated with natural keys.\n",
    "    - Example: `CREATE TABLE colors (id serial, name text);`\n",

    "- For example, if you want to return data from one table conditional on data from another table, but don't need to return any data from the second table, then a subquery may make more logical sense and be more readable. If you need to return data from both tables then you would need to use a join."

    "## Indexes\n",
    "### What are indexes?\n",
    "- An index is a mechanism that SQL engines use to speed up queries. They do this by storing indexed data in a table-like structure, which can be quickly searched using particular search algorithms.\n",
    "- The results of the search provide a link back to the record(s) to which the indexed data belongs.\n",
    "- Using an index means that the database engine can locate column values more efficiently since it doesn't have to search through every record in a table in sequence.\n",
    "### When to use an index?\n",
    "- When you build an index of a field, reads become faster, but every time a row is updated or inserted, the index must be updated as well. \n",
    "- Now you're updating not only the table but also the index, so that's a performance cost.\n",
    "1. Indexes are best used in cases where sequential reading is inadequate. For example: columns that aid in mapping relationships (such as Foreign Key columns), or columns that are frequently used as part of an ORDER BY clause, are good candidates for indexing.\n",
    "2. They are best used in tables and/ or columns where the data will be read much more frequently than it is created or updated.\n",
    "### Creating an index\n",
    "-  When you define a PRIMARY KEY constraint, or a UNIQUE constraint, on a column you automatically create an index on that column. In fact, the index is the mechanism by which these constraints enforce uniqueness.\n",
    "- FOREIGN KEY constraints do not automatically create an index on a column. Foreign Key columns are good candidates for indexing, however you would need to explicitly create the index on the column.\n",
    "- General syntax: `CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (field_name);`\n",
    "    - If index_name is omitted, PostgreSQL automatically generates a unique name for the index. \n",
    "- Multicolumn index syntax: `CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (field_name_1, field_name_2);`\n",

    "### Deleting Indexes\n",

    "## How a query is run\n",
    "- SQL being a predominantly declarative language, in that it describes what needs to be done but not the detail of how to do it. The details of how a query is actually run are abstracted away by the database engine, however it is possible to influence this process by the way you structure your SQL statement.\n",
    "### Assessing a Query with EXPLAIN\n",
    "- In order to execute each query that it receives, PostgreSQL devises an appropriate query plan. The creation of this query plan is one step in the path of executing a query. What EXPLAIN does is allow you to access and read that query plan.\n",
    "- To use `EXPLAIN` you prepend the query with the EXPLAIN keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM books;\n",
    "                     QUERY PLAN\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------\n",
    " Seq Scan on books  (cost=0.00..12.60 rows=260 width=282)\n",
    "(1 row)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The structure of the query plan is a node-tree. The more 'elements' that there are to your query, the more nodes there will be in the tree.\n",
    "- Each node consists of the node type (in this case a sequential scan on the books table) along with estimated cost for that node (start-up cost, followed by total cost), the estimated number of rows to be output by the node, and the estimated average width of the rows in bytes.\n",
    "- However many nodes the query plan has, one of the key pieces of information to look out for in order to compare queries is the estimated 'total cost' value of the top-most node. In the above example that is 12.60.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing a query with EXPLAIN ANALYZE\n",
    "- When you use EXPLAIN, the query is not actually run. \n",
    "- The values that EXPLAIN outputs are estimates, based on the planner's knowledge of the schema and assumptions based on PostgreSQL system statistics. \n",
    "- In order to assess a query using actual data, you can add the ANALYZE option to an EXPLAIN command.\n",
    "- Using the ANALYZE option actually runs the query and, in addition to the output normally returned by EXPLAIN, includes the actual time (in milliseconds) required to run the query and its constituent parts, as well as the actual rows returned by each plan node rather than just a number of rows based on defaults statistics."
