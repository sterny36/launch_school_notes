    "\n",
    "Your Ruby Version Manager is at the top level -- it controls multiple installations of Ruby and all the other tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within each installation of Ruby, you can have multiple Gems -- even 1000s of Gems if you want. Each Gem becomes accessible to the Ruby version under which it is installed. If you want to run a Gem in multiple versions of Ruby, you need to install it in all of the versions you want to use it with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Gem in a Ruby installation can itself have multiple versions. This frequently occurs naturally as you install updated Gems, but can also be a requirement; sometimes you just need a specific version of a Gem for one project, but want to use another version for your other projects.\n",

    "Ruby projects are programs and libraries that make use of Ruby as the primary development language. Each Ruby project is typically designed to use a specific version (or versions) of Ruby, and may also use a variety of different Gems.\n",

    "Finally, Rake is another Gem. It isn't tied to any one Ruby project, but is, instead, a tool that you use to perform repetitive development tasks, such as running tests, building databases, packaging and releasing the software, etc. The tasks that Rake performs are varied, and frequently change from one project to another; you use the Rakefile file to control which tasks your project needs."

   "source": [
    "- Regex are patterns that we can use to search for information of interest in a set of strings. We can use them to perform conditional tests, extract desired information, or even modify information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alphanumerics\n",
    "- `/s/` matches 4 times in \"Mississipi\"\n",
    "```ruby\n",
    "str = 'cast'\n",
    "print \"matched 's'\" if str.match(/s/)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special characters\n",
    "- The following special characters have special meaning in a Ruby or JavaScript regex: `$ ^ * + ? . ( ) [ ] { } | \\ /`\n",
    "- These characters are clled meta-characters. \n",
    "- If you want to match a literal meta-character, you must escape it with a leading backslash `\\`. To match a question mark, for instance, use the regex `/\\?/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concatenation\n",
    "- Patterns are the building blocks of regex, not characters or strings. \n",
    "- You can construct complex regex by concatenating a series of patterns, and you can analyze a complex regex by breaking it down into its component patterns.\n",
    "- The regex `/cat/`, for instance, consists of the concatenation of the c, a, and t patterns, and matches any string that contains a c followed by an a followed by a t.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Alternation (Or)\n",
    "- `/(cat|dog|rabbit)/` matches all instances of \"cat\", \"dog\" and \"rabbit\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Character Escapes\n",
    "- `\\n` new line\n",
    "- `\\t` tab\n",
    "- `\\r` enter\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ignoring Case\n",
    "- Regex are case sensitive by default.\n",
    "- To ignore case append an `i` e.g. `/launch/i`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set of Characters\n",
    "- Character class patterns use a list of characters between square brackets, e.g., `/[abc]/`. Such a pattern matches a single occurrence of any of the characters between the brackets.\n",
    "- Example: The regex `/[abc][12]/` matches any two characters where the first character is an `a`, `b`, or `c`, and the second is a `1` or a `2`.\n",
    "- Within a character set there are only a few meta characters: `^ \\ - [ ]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Range of Characters\n",
    "- For natural sequence of characters abbreviate these ranges inside character classes by specifying the starting character, a hyphen `-`, and the last character. Thus, `/[a-z]/` matches any lowercase alphabetic character, `/[j-p]/` limits that to the letters `j` through `p`, while `/[0-9]/` matches any decimal digit. \n",
    "- Example hexadecimal: `/[0-9A-Fa-f]/`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Negated Classes\n",
    "- Negations look like ordinary character classes, except the first character between the brackets is a caret `^`. \n",
    "- The negated class matches all characters not identified in the range.\n",
    "- Example: `/[^y]/` matches everything apart form \"y\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Character Class Shortcuts\n",
    "- Any character: `.`\n",
    "- Whitespace: `\\s` (space, tab, vertical tab, return, line feed ('\\n'), and form feed ('\\f'))\n",
    "- Non-whitespace: `\\S`\n",
    "- Any decimal digit (0-9): `\\d`\n",
    "- Any character but a decimal digit: `\\D`\n",
    "- Any hexadecimal digit (0-9, A-F, a-f) (Ruby): `\\h`\n",
    "- Any character but a hexadecimal digit (Ruby): `\\H`\n",
    "- Word characters: `\\w` (all alphabetic characters (a-z, A-Z), all decimal digits (0-9), underscore (_)).\n",
    "- Non-word characters: `\\W`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anchors\n",
    "Anchors don't match any characters. What they do is ensure that a regex matches a string at a specific place: the beginning or end of the string or end of a line, or on a word or non-word boundary.\n",
    "- Fix match to start of line: `^`\n",
    "- Fix match to end of line: `$`\n",
    "- Fix match to start of string: `\\A`\n",
    "- Fix match to end of string: `\\z`\n",
