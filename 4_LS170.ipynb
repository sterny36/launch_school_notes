    "- HTTP 1.0:\n",
    "    - The addition of two HTTP methods: HEAD and POST.\n",
    "    - The request line now became more flexible and varied.\n",
    "        - The Request-URI portion of the request line could now either be a path or an absolute URI. \n",

    "- To set up an ecrypted connection TSL performs a TSL Handshake.\n",
    "- Uses a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptography\n",
    "- The bulk of the message exchange is conducted via symmetric key encryption, but the initial symmetric key exchange is conducted using asymmetric key encryption in order to exchange the key for the subsequent symmetric encryption.\n",
    "- TLS assumes TCP is being used at the Transport layer, and the TLS Handshake takes place after the TCP Handshake\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. Immediately after Client received `TCP ACK`, client sends `ClientHello` message that contains among other things: max. supported TSL version, list of supported Ciipher-Suites.\n",
    "2. Server receives `ClientHello` and sends `ServerHello` messsage which: sets the Cipher-Suite and TSL protocol version, the server certificate (which contains the public key and a `ServerHelloDone` marker.\n",
    "3. Client receives `ServerHelloDone` and initiates key exchange process (in order to create the key for the symmetric encryption). The exact procedure depends on which Cipher-Suite was chosen (e.g. RSA, Diffie-Hellman, etc). \n",
    "\n",
    "Example RSA:\n",
    "4. Client generates `pre-master secret`, encrypts it using the server's public key, and sends `ClientKeyExchange` message to the server that contains the encrypted `pre-master secret`,  a `ChangeCipherSpec` flag and a `Finished` flag.\n",
    "5. Server receives the encrypted 'pre-master secret' and decrypt it using its private key.\n",
    "6. Now both client and server will use the 'pre-master' secret, along with some other pre-agreed parameters, to generate the same symmetric key.\n",
    "7. Server  sends a message with `ChangeCipherSpec` and `Finished` flags. The client and server can now begin secure communication using the symmetric key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### TLS Authentication\n",
    "- During the TLS Handshake, as part of its response to the `ClientHello` message, the server provides its certificate. - Part of the function of this certificate is so that the client can use the Public Key contained within it during the key exchange process. \n",
    "- Another function of this certificate is to provide a means of identification for the party providing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Authentication process:\n",
    "1. Server sends its certificate, which includes its public key.\n",
    "2. Server creates a 'signature' in the form of some data signed with the server's private key.\n",
    "3. The signature is sent to the client in a message along with the original data from which the signature was created.\n",
    "4. Client decrypts the signature using the server's public key and compares the decrypted data to the original version.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two versions match then the encrypted version could only have been created by a party in possession of the private key. This proves that the server has access to the private key and therefore is the owner of the certificate.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what's to stop a malicious third-party creating their own key pair and certificate identifying them as, say, a well-known bank? \n",
    "#### Certificate Authorities and the Chain of Trust\n",
    "When a Certificate Authority issues a certificate, it does a couple of important things:\n",
    "1. Verifies that the party requesting the certificate is who they say they are. The way that this is done is up to the CA and will depend to an extent on the type of certificate being issued.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Digitally signs the certificate being issued. This is often done by encrypting some data with the CA's own private key and using this encrypted data as a 'signature'. The unencrypted version of the data is also added to the certificate. In order to verify that the certificate was issued by the CA, the signature can be decrypted using the CA's public key and checked for a match against the unencrypted version.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are different 'levels' of CA. An 'Intermediate CA' can be any company or body authorised by a 'Root CA' to issue certificates on its behalf.\n",
    "    -  If the private key of an Intermediate CA somehow became compromised, the root CA can revoke the certificate for Intermediate, therefore invalidating all of the certificates down the chain from it, and simply issue a new one.\n",
    "- Root Certificates are 'self-signed', and are essentially the end-point of the chain of trust.\n",
    "- Client software, such as browsers, store a list of these authorities along with their Root Certificates (which includes their public key).\n",
    "- When receiving a certificate for checking, the browser can go up the chain to the Root Certificate stored in its list.\n",

    "### TLS Integrity\n",
    "- In the TSL PDU there is a MAC field (Message Authentication Code)\n",
    "- The intention of the MAC field in a TLS record is to add a layer of security by providing a means of checking that the message hasn't been altered or tampered with in transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process:\n",
    "1. Sender will create what's called a digest of the data payload by hashing the payload with a pre-agreed value. This hashing algorithm to be used and hash value will have been agreed as part of the TLS Handshake process when the Cipher Suite is negotiated.\n",
    "2. Sender will encrypt the data payload, encapsulate it into a TLS record, and pass this record down to the Transport layer to be sent to the other party.\n",
    "3. Receiver will decrypt the data payload and create a digest of the payload using the same algorithm and hash value. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the two digests match, this confirms the integrity of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TSL Summary\n",
    "By default HTTP Requests and Responses are transferred in plain text; as such they are essentially insecure.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol to add security to HTTP communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS encryption allows us to encode messages so that they can only be read by those with an authorized means of decoding the message\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS encryption uses a combination of Symmetric Key Encryption and Asymmetric Key Encryption. Encryption of the initial key exchange is performed asymmetrically, and subsequent communications are symmetrically encrypted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TLS Handshake is the process by which a client and a server exchange encryption keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TLS Handshake must be performed before secure data exchange can begin; it involves several round-trips of latency and therefore has an impact on performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher suite is the agreed set of algorithms used by the client and server during the secure message exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS authentication is a means of verifying the identity of a participant in a message exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS Authentication is implemented through the use of Digital Certificates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certificates are signed by a Certificate Authority, and work on the basis of a Chain of Trust which leads to one of a small group of highly trusted Root CAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certificates are exchanged during the TLS Handshake process.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS Integrity provides a means of checking whether a message has been altered or interfered with in transit.\n",
    "\n",
    "TLS Integrity is implemented through the use of a Message Authentication Code (MAC)."

    "## Browser Optimizations\n",
    "Browsers have their own optimizations in order to overcome the performance challenges of today's web. While every browser has specific optimizations, there are two broad types: Document-Aware Optimizations and Speculative Optimizations.\n",
    "- Document-aware optimizations are when the browser leverages networking integrated with parsing techniques to identify and prioritize fetching resources. The goal is to more efficiently load a web page by prioritizing certain resources such as CSS layouts and JS which can take the longest amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Speculative optimizations are when the browser learns the navigation patterns of the user over time and attempts to predict user actions. This can involve pre-resolving DNS names, or even pre-rendering pages to frequently visited sites. Or the browser can open a TCP connection in anticipation of an HTTP request when a user hovers over a link.\n",

    "### HTTP and Real-Time Data Synchronization\n",
    "The HTTP request-response model requires a request to be sent by the client before a response can be returned. So how would we update page content without issuing a request, e.g. to show a notification.\n",
    "#### XHR (XMLHttpReques)\n",
    "- XHR enables clients to manage requests and responses programmatically and asynchronously\n",
    "- XHR is a key component of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (or AJAX for short\n",
    "- While XHR is popular for “real-time” delivery of data updates via the use of polling or long-polling, it may not be the most performant solution when compared to the SSE and WebSocket APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SSE (Server-Sent Events)\n",
    "- SSE is a networking API that enables efficient server-to-client streaming of text-based event data. \n",
    "- It enables the server to send real-time notifications or updates created by the server to the client, without requiring the client to send a request for the updates.\n",
    "- The way that SSE achieves this is through the delivery of messages over a single, long-lived TCP connection. \n",
    "- SSE enables efficient, low-latency server-to-client streaming of text-based data in which the client initiates a connection and the server streams updates to the client. \n",
    "- After the initial handshake to establish the connection, the client can no longer send any data to the server using that particular connection, instead the server uses it to provide real-time data updates to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WebSocket\n",
    "- The WebSocket API is a simple and minimal API that enables us to deliver arbitrary application protocols between the client and server such that either side can send data to the other at any time.\n",
    "- Allows either side to independently send messages to each other. This form of communication is known as bidirectional communication.\n",
    "- Communication over WebSocket consists of messages and application code that does not need to worry about buffering, parsing, and reconstructing received data. \n",
    "- It provides low latency delivery of text and binary application data in both directions and overall is a perfect fit for delivering custom application protocols in the browser.\n",
    "- However, the simplicity and minimal nature of this API comes with a trade-off as the application must account for missing state management, compression, caching, and other services otherwise provided by the browser. "

    "## Peer to Peer Networking\n",
    "With a P2P network, there isn't the same clear separation of roles; instead of a 'client' and a 'server', each computer within the network acts as a 'node'. Within this network architecture, each node is capable of performing the functions that both a client and a server would in the client-server model.\n",
    "- One of the main difficulties in setting up a P2P network involves discovery, i.e. finding other nodes on the network\n",
    "    - One approach is to use flooding. This is where a message is sent out to the network and each node forwards it until a specified number of network 'hops' have elapsed. \n",
    "    - A more structured approach is to use a Distributed Hash Table (DHT). We won't go into the details of exactly how this is implemented, but it is essentially a table of key-value pairs. In a file-sharing context, the key could be a particular filename and the value could be the id of the network node which has the file. The table is split into parts in such a way as to logically map to the underlying structure of nodes within the network, with responsibility maintaining different parts of the table distributed among different nodes.\n",
    "- Historically, browsers have undertaken the role of the client in a client-server architecture. WebRTC however, provides real-time communication functionality within the browser, effectively allowing the browser to act as a node within a P2P communication network.\n",
    "- WebRTC is a collection of standards, protocols, and APIs available in most modern web browsers. \n",
    "    - It abstracts away the complexities of establishing P2P communication between nodes.\n",
    "    - WebRTC uses UDP at the Transport layer. \n",
    "    - Since UDP is connectionless and inherently unreliable, WebRTC combines various different protocols for session establishment and maintenance (STUN, TURN, ICE), for security (DTLS), and for congestion and flow control and a certain level of reliability (SRTP, SCTP)."
